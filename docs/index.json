While these tutorials are mostly a reminder for me, you’re welcome to use them if they’re any help to you.\nTutorials  I try to ensure they’re as accurate as possible and hope they’re helpful, but make no guarantees that they’re correct or up–to–date; use at your own risk.\nThe tutorials are licensed as CC BY-NC so you can use them for free, you just can’t make money from them.\nStatistics tutorials As well as the tutorials here my stats101 website might also be useful if you want an introduction to statistics.\nAbout me I’m a geographer.\nAbout me\n",
