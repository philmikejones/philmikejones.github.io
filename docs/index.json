I use R, Python, and QGIS to analyse various spatial and non-spatial data sets. I’ve authored some packages, most notably rakeR for simulating spatial data.  Education PhD I have a PhD in human geography from the University of Sheffield (2018). My thesis is entitled, ‘A Spatial Microsimulation Analysis of Health Inequalities and Health Resilience’. I was supervised by Professors Dimitris Ballas and Liddy Goyder, with support from Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council, especially Laurie Mott.\nYou can read the manuscript or view the source code.\nPrevious  PhD in human geography from the University of Sheffield (2017) MA with distinction in social research from the University of York (2010) BA (Hons) in Sociology from the University of York (2005)  Role I’m a senior lecturer at the University of Derby in the Department of Criminology and Social Sciences, where I teach social science research methods.\nPrevious  Previously I was a postdoctoral researcher on the “Long-term impacts of ‘Thatcherism’: crime, politics and inequality” project.

While these tutorials are mostly a reminder for me, you’re welcome to use them if they’re any help to you.\nTutorials  I try to ensure they’re as accurate as possible and hope they’re helpful, but make no guarantees that they’re correct or up–to–date; use at your own risk.\nThe tutorials are licensed as CC BY-NC so you can use them for free, you just can’t make money from them.\nStatistics tutorials As well as the tutorials here my stats101 website might also be useful if you want an introduction to statistics.\nAbout me I’m a geographer.\nAbout me\n",
