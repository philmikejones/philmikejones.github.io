Configure ssh server with encrypted home directory
==================================================

date: 2015-07-17

The following instructions are to set up an ssh server on Ubuntu linux
with an encrypted home directory.

Throughout ``<username>`` refers to an actual username like ``phil``.

Install OpenSSH server:

.. code:: bash

   sudo apt-get install openssh-server

Create a backup of ``sshd_config`` (NOT ``ssh_config``, note the ``d``)

.. code:: bash

   sudo cp /etc/ssh/sshd_config /etc/ssh/sshd_config.factory-defaults

Configure ``sshd_config`` to initially accept password logins:

.. code:: bash

   sudo chmod a-w /etc/ssh/sshd_config.factory-defaults
   sudo gedit /etc/ssh/sshd_config

Change the line ``#PasswordAuthentication yes`` to read
``PasswordAuthentication yes`` (i.e. remove the ``#``) and only allow
certain users:

.. code:: bash

   PasswordAuthentication yes
   AllowUsers <username>

Finally tell the configuration file to look in
``/etc/ssh/<username>/authorized_keys`` for client keys. The default is
to look in ``~/.ssh/`` which is no good because this is encrypted until
you’ve logged in! Change ``AuthorizedKeysFile`` to:

.. code:: bash

   AuthorizedKeysFile    /etc/ssh/<username>/authorized_keys

Close ``gedit``. Restart the ssh server with:

.. code:: bash

   sudo service ssh restart

Next create the ``authorized_keys`` file and give it the appropriate
permissions:

.. code:: bash

   sudo mkdir /etc/ssh/<username>/
   sudo chown username /etc/ssh/<username>
   sudo chmod 755 /etc/ssh/<username>
   sudo touch /etc/ssh/<username>/authorized_keys
   sudo chown username /etc/ssh/<username>/authorized_keys
   sudo chmod 644 /etc/ssh/<username>/authorized_keys

Then copy the client’s public key to ``authorized_keys``. The easiest
way to do that is to ssh in to the server (which is why we allowed
password logins earlier) and do it from there. So from the client:

.. code:: bash

   nano ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

Copy the key to the clipboard then:

.. code:: bash

   ssh username@host

Enter log in password when prompted, then:

.. code:: bash

   nano /etc/ssh/<username>/authorized_keys  # Paste the key here and save

Then logout:

.. code:: bash

   logout

Disable password logins from ``/etc/ssh/sshd_config`` and restart the
ssh server (``sudo service ssh restart`` from the server). Log in is now
done using the ssh keys and without prompting for a password. The client
will prompt to see if the public key fingerprint sent from the server is
correct and to add it to the white list. Check it’s right by running
``ssh-keygen -l -f /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key`` on the server.
