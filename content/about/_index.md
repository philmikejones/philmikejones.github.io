## Publications

You can see my publications on my [ORCiD profile](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5173-3245).


## Specialisms

- I specialise in quantitative and spatial data analysis.
- I use R, Python, and QGIS to analyse various spatial and non-spatial data sets.
- I've authored some [packages](https://github.com/philmikejones), most notably [rakeR](https://cran.r-project.org/package=rakeR) for simulating spatial data. 


## Education

### PhD

I have a PhD in human geography from the University of Sheffield (2018).
My thesis is entitled, 'A Spatial Microsimulation Analysis of Health Inequalities and Health Resilience'. 
I was supervised by Professors [Dimitris Ballas](https://www.rug.nl/staff/d.ballas/cv?lang=en) and [Liddy Goyder](https://www.sheffield.ac.uk/scharr/sections/ph/staff/profiles/liddy), with support from [Doncaster Metropolitan Borough Council](http://www.doncaster.gov.uk/), especially Laurie Mott.
