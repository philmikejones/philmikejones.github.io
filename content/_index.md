## Tutorials

I use R, Python, QGIS, and Linux in my work and over the years have written a series of reminders and tutorials to help me when I inevitably forget things.
While these tutorials are mostly a reminder for me, you're welcome to use them if they're any help to you.

I try to ensure they're as accurate as possible and hope they're helpful, but make no guarantees that they're correct or up--to--date; use at your own risk.

The tutorials are licensed as [**CC BY-NC**](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/) so you can use them for free, you just can't make money from them.


## Statistics tutorials

As well as the tutorials here my [stats101](https://philmikejones.github.io/stats101/) website might also be useful if you want an introduction to statistics.

## About me
